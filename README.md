# Xpenda-App

> The Ruby on Rails project is about building a **mobile web application** where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what. 

I created an application that allows the user to:
- register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
- introduce new transactions associated with a category.
- see the money spent on each category.


## Built With

- Ruby
- Rails
- Postgresql
- CSS
- Tailwind
